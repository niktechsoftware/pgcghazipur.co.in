								<b><h3>P.G College Ghazipur</h3></b> 
<p style="padding-left:20px; line-height:25px;">Post-Graduate college has five decades of rich and spectacular history,one whose total contents defy description but from which,atleast major events can be highlighted.<br/><br/> 
In April 1956,we formed the Degree College Association-a philanthropic society for promotion,Integration,creation and dissemination of knowledge. It is an umbrella association, which has conceptualized and constituted from time to time, several academic, scientific and technical bodies, concordant with societal needs and global academic environment.<br/><br/>
We have constantly moved up the growth ladder sans profit-motive. Our faith in spiritual rather than material values has kept us impermeable to contarminations introduced by market forces Ushering value-based education that promoted human excellence and enhances competitive abilities in today's academic world is Herculean task in itseft.<br/><br/>
We nurtured a dream to become a leading technical institute with a global vision. Today, the dream has become a reality as PGC academicians and students alike have gained due recongnition for their academic and professional excellence.
As Chairman of PGC Ghazipur.I welcome you to this fascinating Institution.Looking forward to your valuable association with us.
